8 Dec 2014 - added capacitance calculation following WP calculation
           - added proper handling of undepleted voxels in WP calculation
	   - can now calculate realistic signals without full depletion
12-20 Dec 2014 - added charge cloud self-repulsion
               - added field dependence of diffusion coefficient
	       - added surface charge, quadratic charge profile, radial charge profiles
	       - added logging of config params to start of field and WP files
Dec 2016
      - added hole, inner taper length, outer taper length, taper angle
Nov  2017: added top bulletization
May-July 2019
      - added dead layer / Li thickness
      - added over-relaxation factor; gained factor of ~ 40 speedup, depending on size/grid
      - added code to estimate full-depletion voltage in the case of bubble depletion (pinch-off)
      - added -r option to allow reading of z-impurity profile from a .spe file
Nov-Dec 2019 - many changes, restructured fieldgen
      - broke out functions grid_init, ev_calc, wp_calc, write_ev, write_wp, do_relax, interpolate
      - got an additional factor of ~3 speedup
      - more modular and readable
      - added code to properly handle pixels next to p+ and n+ contacts
        - much better calculation of V and E near contacts



TO DO:

- siggen: measure cpu time and try to optimize 
    - lots of redundant operations in efield_exists()
    - if vel << grid size, calculate dq/dt, number of steps?
    - can we combine calls to grid_weights?
    	  - ipt and w in setup? also rlen, zlen, etc?

- re-implement WD=1 option
